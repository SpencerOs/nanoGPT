    "Recap on how this works:\n",
    "- each token in each stage of wei knows what content it has as well as where it is located at\n",
    "- all of the nodes (because it's a lower triangular matrix, that means only values that came before) emit keys; one of the keys will have the highest value & be selected to create a dot-product with a high affinity\n",
    "- Due to whichever key emitted the highest value after the softmax, we'll end up aggregting a lot of its information into the current position (we'll get to learn a lot about it)\n",
    "- the key says \"here is where I currently am/have\"\n",
    "- the query says \"here is what I am interested in\"\n",
    "- the value takes whichever matrix was found from querying the key, and says \"here is what I have to communicate to you, *relevant info*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick notes:\n",
    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. It can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at ech other and aggregating informataion with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimensinos is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other.\n",
    "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the line that does the masking with tril, allowing all tokens to communicate. Our example here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has tringular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modelling. \n",
    "    - Sometimes you want to be able to let a token \"see the future\" so that you can do things such as adjusting for the sentiment that is being written with.\n",
    "    - One of the cool things about attention is that it doesn't care, attention supports arbitrary connection between all the nodes.\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from `x`, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention additionally divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size) . This makes it so that when input `Q`, `K` are unit variance, `wei` will be unit variance too, and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much."
